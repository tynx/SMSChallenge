#SMSChallenge

Welcome to SMSChallenge
---
SMSChallenge is a service which provides a 2 step authentication including a challenge via SMS.

The initial use for this project was for VPN User authentication via a free radius server.
A user connects to the VPN, enters a username + PIN, then receives a password vis SMS/Text, which is then entered in a second step into the VPN authentication. So the User needs to know his username and have his phone available (two factors).

User details can be pulled from Active Directory (LDAP), SMS are sent via email or an USB modem.
The whole server can be run on a Raspberry PI!

SMSChallenge is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see chapter [License](#License) for more details. 
 
Architecture / Design
---
* First step of the authentication is a normal login with a username and a password. Usernames for VPN can be distincted by a prefix. 
* If this login was successful, the SMSChallenge-module sends a challenge(one-time-token) in form of an sms. This challenge has to be entered into the VPN client. This is the second authentication step.

* MySQL is used for storing the users and their passwords. The SMSChallenge-module is a simple plugin for one of the biggest RADIUS-Server (Freeradius).

* Users can be synchronised against an Active Directory (AD) Group via LDAP (done in PHP). This feature minimizes the effort of an administrator to keep track of VPN-Users which should (not) have acceess. Don't worry if you don't use AD/LDAP, you can work with normal SMSChallenge-internal accounts.

* A simple WebGUI written in PHP allows administrators to manage the VPN-Users and their access.
* An even simpler CLI provides a bashy way of managing users. (Not very complete at this stage of the project).

Installation
---

Clone the project into /opt. (Recommended, but feel free to drop it somewhere else)

Also install following packages from your OS repository

- bsd-mailx OR/AND gnokii-cli (depends on what you use, see "Chapter" [config](#config) of the module)
- libmysqlclient-dev
- gcc/cc
- freeradius
- libfreeradius-dev

---

Then create the database and functions:
```
mysql -u user -p < mysql_install.sql
mysql -u user -p < MySQLFunctions
```
It may be a good idea to make a separate mysql-user just for smschallenge.

----

Create the config for CLI/Web/Sync (the c-module is unaffected by these settings):
You can either store the config in the lib directory (where the config-loader is located) or /etc. (/etc is recommended).
```
cp smschallenge.conf.example /etc/smschallenge.conf
```
Some notes to the different settings:

- LDAP-Settings can be empty in case the syncing against the AD/LDAP is not used. Otherwise provide an LDAP-Account that has enough permissions to read out the users of a OU (Group).
  - Also what is needed for LDAP (or not if you don't use AD/LDAP) are the configs: base_ou_for_groups, groups_to_sync, ldap_schema_user
- There are 3 types of logging possible: file, mysql, syslog
  - They can be combinated (comma seperated)
  - All the settings in the category "LOG" apply for all types except: syslog_prefix and log_file
- auth_type is for the kind of authentication used for the WebGUI. In case you sync your users against AD/LDAP you may wanna use "mod_kerb_auth" for apache. Then set the auth_type to "kerberos". The other possibility is to use internal, which authenticates agains the mysql-table "user".
- password_length(min/max) is for setting the min/max length for the passwords which can be set via the GUI
- default_password is set for a user, when it's created by the admin via the WebGUI or CLI
- web_admins are the users, which are allowed to make changes to the users and view the log-messages

---

Create the first (admin) user WITHOUT LDAP:
```
php -e cli/main.php adduser
```
Default PW is 123456

Create the first (admin) user WITH LDAP:
```
php -e sync/sync.php syncuser [[YOUR USERNAME]]
```

Add the user to the admins (in conf file)! 


---

Activate WebGUI:
The easiest way is to create a symbolic link.
```
ln -s /opt/smschallenge/web /var/www/smschallenge
```

Other option is to move/copy the folder and to adapt the include.php.
```
cp -r /opt/smschallenge/web /var/www/smschallenge
```
Edit the include.php and change the "lib_dir" to: /opt/smschallenge/lib

---

Activate Sync (in case you use AD/LDAP, otherwise skip this step):
This is basically done with a single entry in the crontab:
```
0 0 * * * /usr/bin/php -e /opt/smschallenge/sync/sync.php sync

```
---

Freeradius (installing it is up to you)
This section is all about the directory "smschallenge/freeradius"
Compile the module.
```
$ make
```
This will not only compile the module, but also create the file: smschallenge. This is the config for the module. Please configure everything needed. Later in this "Chapter" you can see every send-method explained in detail. All the other properties that deserve a comment are in this list:

-  challenge_string: This will be printed at the users client when he waits for the SMS.
-  sms_class: This allows SMS's to be sent as "Flash-SMS". Note this feature is only available for the "AT"-method
-  acs_server: As you may have multiple login-methods running in one freeradius-instance, this parameter allows you to drop request which do not come from certain server.
-  account_length: Max length of the account-name(username)
-  vpn_prefix: this allows you to distinct smschallenge users, in case you have multiple vpn-authentications running.
-  max_password_length: defines the max length of the user-pw
-  code_blocks: one code block contains 3 digits. So this number multiplied by 3 is the number of digits sent via sms.

Then install the module with:
```
# make install
```
This copies the compiled module into the plugin folder of freeradius and also copies the config file into "/etc/freeradius/modules/smschallenge".

You have to tell freeradius to use smschallenge, to do so, edit the file "/etc/freeradius/sites-available/default".
```
authorize{
	preprocess
	smschallenge
}

authenticate{
	Auth-Type SMSCHALLENGE{
		smschallenge
	}
}

```

Preprocess is needed!

Start freeradius in debug mode to see details about the module/plugin:
```
# freeradius -XX
```

Installation on Raspberry PI
---
##Complete Installation Process SMSChallenge on an Raspberry PI:

First of all download the raspbian image.
Go to http://raspberrypi.org/downloads/ and download the latest raspbian image.

When it's done copy the image to the SD-Card. (the tool dd is probably the simplest)

This will take some minutes. After it's done insert the SD-Card to the PI and boot it.
Now the raspi-config should be displayed.
It is recommended (and this is also the configuration in the provided image) to do the following:

	Run expand_rootfs.
	Disable overscan.
	configure_keyboard (generic driver, en_us)
	change_pass (smschallenge)
	change_locale (utf8 en_us, env: en_us)
	change_timezone(UTC)
	memory_split (16)
	overclock ( 800mhz modest)
	ssh (enable)
	boot_behaviour (don't boot to desktop)

Now set the root password:
```
sudo passwd root
yourPassword(image: smschallenge)
```

Now logout the current user 'pi'. (ctrl+d / exit) and login as root.

Rename the user 'pi' to smschallenge, also rename his group and move his home and set the permission to it.
```
sudo usermod -l smschallenge pi
groupmod pi -n smschallenge
mv /home/pi/ /home/smschallenge
chown smschallenge /home/smschallenge 
chgrp smschallenge /home/smschallenge

And now change the home in the passwd file
nano /etc/passwd 
```

Change the hostname in the following two files.
Change raspberrypi to your hostname. If you don't set the domain apache will throw warning messages. ( hostname.domain)
```
nano /etc/hosts
nano /etc/hostname/
Now tell the system to change the hostname with the following command.
hostname -F /etc/hostname
```

For the next step (installing the needed packages) make sure you got an internet-connection.

```
sudo -s
apt-get udpate
apt-get install mysql-server-5.5
apt-get install apache2
apt-get install php5
apt-get install php5-ldap
apt-get install php5-mysql
apt-get install freeradius
apt-get install libfreeradius-dev
apt-get install gnokii
apt-get install git
apt-get install usb-modeswitch
apt-get install cu
apt-get upgrade
apt-get install mailx
```

Now pull SMSChallenge:
```
cd /opt/
git clone https://github.com/tynx/SMSChallenge
```

First setup the database.
```
mysql -u root -p
\. mysql_install.sql
\. MySQLFunctions
CREATE USER 'smschallenge'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'smschallenge'
GRANT ALL ON smschallenge.*  TO 'smschallenge'@'localhost'
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```


Now set the configuration:
```
cp  smschallenge.conf.example /etc/smschallenge.conf
nano /etc/smschallenge.conf
```

If u want to use an modem to send the sms go to the chapter modem installation.

Now let's compile the freeradius modules.
Go to smschallenge/freeradius/
Now compile it with the following 2 commands:
```
cd ./freeradius
sudo make
sudo make install
```

Create an Link in /var/www/ and check the permission of the web folder. 
```
ln -s /opt/smschallenge/web/ /var/www/web
```

Last but no least write the cronjob to automate the snycing of the users. (If you use ldap sync)
```
crontab -e
0 0 * * * /bin/bash php -e /opt/smschallenge/sync/sync.php sync
```

After you checked everything, SMSChallenge is ready to go!


##Setup SMSChallenge on a raspberry pi with the provided image

Go to github.com/tynx/SMSChallenge and download the .img.

[Download the image.](http://bit.ly/13GwJdy)
Copy the image to the SD-Card (with dd)

I recommend that you run raspi-config and change the configuration.
Expand the rootfilesystem
Change the hostname in the following two file.
If you don't set the domain apache will throw warning messages. ( hostname.domain)

```
nano /etc/hosts
nano /etc/hostname/
Now tell the system to change the hostname with the following command.
hostname -F /etc/hostname
```

An apt-get upgrade is recommended!

It's recommend to change all the passwords.  ( again, the standart PW is: smschallenge)
Notice: Don't forget to also change the password in the config files!
```
sudo passwd root
> your password
sudo passwd smschallenge
> your password
```

```
mysql -u root -p
> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('myNewPass') WHERE User='root';
> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('myNewPass') WHERE User='smschallenge';
> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Now set your configuration:
```
nano /etc/smschallenge.conf
```

Now you Raspberry PI should be ready to go.

Notice:
If you want to use a modem to send the SMS you might see the chapter #modem installation



##modem installation

This is an guideline to get the vodafone k3715 working, you need to change the vendor and product if u use another modem.
First of all change the blacklist, comment out the blacklistet entries "blacklist spi-bcm2708" and "blacklist i2c-bcm2708"

```
nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf 
```

Next set the config for the modem:

Create a file in /etc/modprobe.d/huawei.conf and insert 'options usbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x140c'
```
nano /etc/modprobe.d/huawei.conf
```

Edit the file /etc/modules and insert 'usbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x140c'
```
nano /etc/modules
```

Unload all usb drivers and reload usbserial

```
modprobe -r option
modprobe -r usb_wwan
modprobe -r usbserial
modprobe usbserial
```

Now an ls -alh on /dev/ttyUSB* should show you your modem on /dev/ttyUSB0-3

Set the options for the usbserial driver and for the modem
```
stty -F /dev/ttyUSB0 -isig -icanon -iexten -echo -echoe -echok -echoctl -echoke -opost -onlcr -brkint -icrnl -imaxbel min 1 time 0 ispeed 9600 ospeed 9600
modprobe usbserial vendor=0x12d1 product=0x140c
```

Change the owner of ttyUSB0

```
chown uucp /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Last but not least test if the modem works. (sendsms.c, minicom or cu)


#Send method: at
If you want to test out your physical modem(if any is used) there is a small C-Programm which does exactly that. It contains the identical code, which is run inside the module. Compile it like this:
```
make sendsms
```
And test your modem like:
```
./sendsms 'sms test' NUMBER /dev/YOUR_DEVICE
```

It may be that your serial connection is not set up properly by linux by default. These properties worked for most of the tested modems so far:
```
stty -F /dev/YOUR_DEVICE -isig -icanon -iexten -echo -echoe -echok -echoctl -echoke -opost -onlcr -brkint -icrnl -imaxbel min 1 time 0 ispeed 9600 ospeed 9600
```
Make sure you set these properties at startup if they're needed.

If you got issues, you can try to connect to the modem by hand and maybe you'll find the error.
```
sudo cu -l /dev/YOUR_DEVICE -s 9600
Connected.
AT
OK
AT+CFUN=1
OK
AT+CMGF=1
OK
AT+CSMP=17,167,0,16
OK
AT+CMGS="YOUR NUMBER"
> test message (note: Hit Ctrl+Z after entering your message for sending the message)
 
+CMGS: 87
 
OK
```

#Send method: mailx
You can have your codes sent by email. This is done via the binary "mailx". The mails are send to "the_users_phonenumber@your_gateway_configured_in_config.com". To test this method run:
```
echo "test message" | mailx "the_users_phonenumber@your_gateway_configured_in_config.com"
```

#Send method: gnokii
This is a binary that allows to have an easy CLI to communicate with physical modems. 
To test this method run:
```
echo "test message" | gnokii --sendsms YOUR_NUMBER
```

Sample config of a gnokii config-file
```
[global]
port = /dev/YOUR_DEVICE
model = AT
initlength = default
connection = serial
use_locking = no
serial_baudrate = 19200
serial_write_usleep = 10000
smsc_timeout = 20
```

#Send method: which one to take?
At the beginning, we were using gnokii and with most modems it works very reliable. One issue we discovered over time: the speed. It does so much resetting and configuring before each sms, that it can be too slow for what we use it in this software. That's why we wrote a "native" version. And because our modems aren't 100% reliable we use a mail-to-sms gateway as fallback (via mailx)
